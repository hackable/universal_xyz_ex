# Orderbook WebSocket Server Issues

This document tracks the identified issues in the orderbook-ws-server and their status.

## Resolved Issues

### 1. No Error Handling for Database Connection Failures
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**: Implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff in `database.ts` that attempts to reconnect up to 5 times with increasing delays.
- **Benefits**: Improves resilience against temporary database unavailability and prevents immediate application failure during connectivity issues.

### 2. Limited Input Validation
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**: 
  - Created a comprehensive validation utility in `src/utils/validation.ts`
  - Updated the WebSocket server to validate Ethereum addresses, token amounts, expiration dates, and signature formats
  - Added cryptographic signature validation against the smart contract
- **Benefits**: Prevents invalid or malicious data from entering the system and provides specific error feedback to clients.

### 3. No Rate Limiting
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented a token bucket algorithm for rate limiting in `src/utils/rate-limiter.ts`
  - Applied rate limiting to both connections per IP and messages per IP
  - Added maximum total connection limit to prevent server overload
  - Made rate limiting parameters configurable via environment variables
- **Benefits**: Prevents denial-of-service attacks, reduces server load, and ensures fair resource allocation.

### 4. Error Handling in Event Listeners
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented a retry queue system for blockchain event processing in `contract.ts`
  - Added exponential backoff with jitter for retry attempts
  - Created separate methods for event processing with proper error handling
  - Made retry parameters configurable via environment variables
- **Benefits**: Ensures blockchain events are processed reliably even during temporary failures and prevents data loss during network or database issues.

### 5. Database Synchronization with `alter: true`
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**:
  - Modified the database initialization to be environment-aware
  - Limited automatic schema alterations to development environments only
  - Disabled automatic schema synchronization in production for safety
  - Added optional force sync parameter for controlled migrations
- **Benefits**: Prevents accidental schema changes in production, which could lead to data loss or corruption, while maintaining development convenience.

### 6. No Structured Logging System
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented a structured logging system using Winston in `src/utils/logger.ts`
  - Created different log levels (error, warn, info, http, debug) with appropriate colors
  - Added support for console logging in development and file-based logging for all environments
  - Log files are organized by level with error logs in a separate file for easier troubleshooting
  - Made log level configurable via environment variables
- **Benefits**: Provides consistent, structured logging throughout the application, improving error tracking, debugging, and system monitoring capabilities.

### 7. Hardcoded Values
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**:
  - Extracted hardcoded ping interval (30 seconds) to configurable `WS_PING_INTERVAL` environment variable
  - Added configurable subscription limit for token/maker subscriptions via `SUBSCRIPTION_LIMIT` environment variable
  - Made all configuration values accessible through environment variables with sensible defaults
  - Updated documentation and `.env.example` file with all available configuration options
- **Benefits**: Allows operators to tune the system based on their specific infrastructure requirements without code changes, improving adaptability across different deployment environments.

### 8. WebSocket Connection Management
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented connection limits with configurable maximum connections
  - Added proper connection tracking with cleanup on disconnect
  - Improved error handling for WebSocket connections
  - Implemented reconnection logic with exponential backoff on the client side
  - Added connection timeouts to prevent stale connections
- **Benefits**: Prevents resource exhaustion, improves system stability, and enhances client experience with reliable connections.

### 10. No Health Check Endpoint
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented a RESTful health check API using Express.js
  - Added two endpoints: `/health` for basic status and `/health/detailed` for comprehensive checks
  - Included database connectivity testing in the detailed health check
  - Made the health API port configurable via environment variables with fallback options if the default port is in use
  - Added appropriate CORS headers for integration with monitoring tools
  - Improved error handling for health API startup to prevent application crashes
- **Benefits**: Enables operational monitoring, facilitates automated health checks, and simplifies integration with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

### 11. Error Response Consistency
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**:
  - Standardized error responses across the WebSocket server using consistent JSON format
  - Added structured error logging using Winston with error metadata
  - Improved error handling in WebSocket server initialization for port-in-use errors
  - Enhanced API error responses with detailed information and appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Added fallback mechanisms for common error scenarios (e.g., port conflicts)
- **Benefits**: Improves client experience with predictable error formats, simplifies client-side error handling, and facilitates debugging with consistent logging patterns.

## Remaining Issues

### 9. Limited Documentation
- **Status**: ⏳ TODO
- **Description**: Comments exist but more comprehensive JSDoc would improve maintainability.

### 12. Lack of TypeScript Strict Mode
- **Status**: ⏳ TODO
- **Description**: The tsconfig.json might not enforce strict type checking.
